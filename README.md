GmailThis! Dangerous Penguins Inc.


GmailThis! Dangerous Penguins Inc. henceforth referred to as GTDPI - Is a bookmarklet based on GmailThis! http://www.contrapants.org/2005/07/gmailthis.html  and GmailThis! for bookmarking http://nikak.blogspot.com/2005/12/txt-gmailthis-modified-for-bookmarking.html

GTDPI is essentially a very quick way to send a link through gmail. After clicking the bookmark and the following happens;

1: A new window will pop up
2: The 'To' Field will be populated as you configure it to in the bookmarklet (just edit targetEmailAddress)
3: The 'Subject' of the email filled out as the title of your current webpage followed by “--- (bookmark)” to make future searching more easy.
4: The email 'Body' is whatever text you have highlighted followed by the URL of the current page. 

Shortly after you click send the window will disappear.

What's different about this and other GmailThis! Variations? The Java Script has been cleaned up and formatted to make it easier to customize and there is also a bugfix that allows the bookmarklet work on all page titles. Previously, some titles with special characters would fail to work.
